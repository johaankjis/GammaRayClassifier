# Astro Particle Classifier
This project classifies gamma rays using data from the MAGIC Gamma Telescope. It employs machine learning models to distinguish between gamma ray and hadron events based on Cherenkov radiation patterns. The repository includes data preprocessing scripts, multiple classifiers, and Jupyter notebooks for analysis and evaluation.
